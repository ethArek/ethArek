### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## :boy: Who am I 
My name is Arek. Currently I'm a junior backend developer from Poland. In my job I work with Node.js, Typescript, Go, React.js, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, RabbitMQ and many more. 
Programming is my passion, so I build my own projects after work.
I'm a big fan of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, especially Ethereum and Opacity. 

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- Pascal (see - [Pascal-code-examples](https://github.com/ethArek/Pascal-code-examples/))
- React.js
- Solidity
- Electronics (Arduino, Raspberry Pi)

## âš¡ Fun facts
- I started programming when I was 12.
- My first programming language was Pascal - I have cool memories with those times (Turbo Pascal 7.0) - this is why I learn modern Pascal now.
- I study Computer Science on Cracow University of Technology
- Catholic :heavy_plus_sign:
